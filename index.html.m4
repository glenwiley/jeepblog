               This page is intended to provide a record of the work
               that I am doing to repair and restore my Jeep CJ2A.
               I purchased the jeep on November 14, 2016 for $2700. The
               vital stats are:

               <p>

               This is a 1947 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_CJ#CJ-2A">Willy's Jeep CJ2A</a>
               that was converted to 12V before I bought it.  There are a few "repairs" that are not original
               but most of this Jeep is original equipment for the CJ2A.  The frame and sheet metal were in
               great shape, there are a few holes in a few of the side panels but it has remarkably little rust.
