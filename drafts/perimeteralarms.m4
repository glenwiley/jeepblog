<h2>Perimeter Alarms<small>2016-02-02</small></h2>

If the probability of needing some sort of perimeter security in the
event of a civil disruption is fairly high.  Even if you have set things up to
ensure that you have enough people to pull twenty four hour guard duty you
should consider deploying perimeter alarms.  It is a lot harder than you think
to stay alert and aware of your environment when you are on gurad duty, if you
are on your own then it is impossible (we all have to sleep sometime).

<p>

Those of us that have expect to need to employ a "get home" strategy or a
"bug out" strategy that may take more than one day will definitely need to
consider how we secure our perimiter while we rest during travel.  

<p>

I distinguish between perimiter alarms and perimiter security that are deployed
during travel versus those deployed at a more permanent location. The perimiter
at your permanent location can be secured using alarms and security devices
that are bulky and not easily moved but are very effective.  Perimiter security
for someone on the move on foot or in a single vehicle needs to be light,
portable and quick to setup and take down.

<h3>Transient Perimiter Security</h3>

Transient perimiter security includes devices and strategies that you can
deploy from a backpack or small storage location in a vehicle.  First, consider
your goals for transient perimiter security:

<dl>
   <dt>Lightweight and portable</dt>
   <dd>You need to be able to add these tools to your get home bag or 
       bug out bag without breaking your back.  You have to ask yourself
       what must be removed from your BOB or GHB to make room for perimiter
       security - weight the risks.</dd>
   <dt>Fast to deploy</dt>
   <dd>If you on a multi-day trip from a remote work location or on your
       way to a bug out location you want to spend as much time as possible
       moving, not setting up and tearing down camp.</dd>
   <dt>Focus on Alarms, not traps</dt>
   <dd>En route you are going to be more concerned about knowing when 
       someone approaches rather than injuring them.  When you are on the move
       you are in someone else's territory and you really don't want to pick
       fights with people unnecessarily. It is a lot easier to apologize
       for alarming someone than for hurting them.  This rules out things
       like punji sticks, dead falls, etc.</dd>
</dl>

<p>

With our goals in mind, let's consider the types of terrain that might comprise
a transient perimiter.  While some of these terrain types can share solutions,
some have peculiar needs.  

<ul>
   <li>Buildings including doors and windows</li>
   <li>Wooded camp sites</li>
   <li>Small shelters such as sheds and immobilized trucks</li>
   <li>Non-wooded areas such as plains, sand dunes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>

One of the most important ways to secure your perimiter is to choose you
ground carefully.  Look for a site that has the fewest points of ingress
but still offers you at least two ways in and out so that you can escape
if you need to.  When you decide to take a break for the night (or day)
think about the resources available to you in the immediate area that can
be used to build a perimiter security system.

<p>

Think about how large your perimiter must be.  If you can find a structure
or building then things can be simpler, but in the outdoors you really need
to find a way to secure a pretty large area.  One rule is that an attacker
can close a distance of 21 feet faster than an alert victim can draw and employ
a holstered side arm.  How much notice do you need if you are sleeping?

<p>

Part of perimiter security is making it hard for an attacker to move to 
your location.  Delaying their approach involves both concealing your
specific location as well as possible and introducing obstancles that
must be navigated to reach you. 

<h4>Annunciators</h4>

You want to use something that will reliably alert you.  You should trigger it
enough prior to a SHTF event that you can be confident that you recognize the
sound.  Although battery operated alarms are easy to get and use, I am loathe
to rely on battery operated anything because batteries fail, are heavy and
eventually you run out of spares.

<p>

You best bet is to use objects already available in the terrain.  For example,
you can lean a fallen tree branch against a tree and tie a trip line to it and
a solid terr or post so that the trip wire will cause the tree branch to fall 
and make noise.

<p>

If you can find metal cans from the trash in the area, you can put a few
small rocks in them and tie them to trip wires.

<p>

Are you in a building?  Can you rig a trip wire to drop something on a 
window pane?  Wine, beer and soda Bottles don't make good alrams because they 
often survive a fall, but wine glasses, shards from a window pane or thin
drinking glasses that fall on concrete or brick work great.

<h3>Think Layers And Direction</h3>

If you have the luxury of setting up a few layers do it.  What if a mal-actor
spots your only trip wire or the trip wire fails to trigger the noise maker or
the noise make doesn't wake you up?

<p>

When possible you should have both an outer and inner perimiter, ideally with
different annunciators so that you can tell how close trespassers are.  For
example if you use rattle cans on the interrior perimiter, set up a board
or tree branch to fall on another board ot sheet of plastic siding on the
outer perimiter.

<p>

An added bonus is if you have a couple of different types of noise makers
that can be used to tell you which direction someone is coming from.

<h3>Packing list</h3>

A good starter list of things that you should pack to cover transient
perimiter security include:

<ul>
   <li>Monofilament (fishing line) or dark string to use as a trip wire.  You
       need more of this than you might think.  If you are in a building
       then you can span door ways and windows, but if you are in the woods
       or more open areas you might need multiple fifty foot lengths!  An
       area the size of a typical small (1000sf) ranch house will require 
       140ft and that still is not a large area.</li>
   <li>Annunciators/noise makers that can be tied to a trip line and trigger
   when the line is pulled.  These need to transport quietly so rattle cans
   would need to be stuffed or separated from their contents (making them a
   poor choice for packing in your BOB).</li>
   <li>Tent stakes or spikes that can be used to secure trip wires</li>
</ul>

<h3>Permanent Perimiter Security</h3>

Perimiter security for your compound or a even a semi-permanent location
can be handled far more thoroughly than transient perimiter security.  You
have the luxury of taking your time to build things that can not be easily 
moved and you can draw on heavy or bulky supplies if this is a bug out 
location.

<p>

Some of the ideas we explored for transient perimeter security can be applied
to permanent perimeter security, but there are many more options to consider
as well:

<h4>Annunciators</h4>

In addition to the annunciators described for transient perimiters, we have the
luxury of also using:

<dl>
   <dt>Rattle cans</dt>
   <dd>Soup cans (or soda cans) with pebbles, metal bits, etc. can be
       attached to a trip line or fence line.  When the line is touched
       the can will rattle.  These should be camoflaged by painting with
       a matte color that will blend in with the terrain or even smeared with
       clay (doesn't wash off well in the rain), tree sap and dirt
       or other sticky stuff.</dd>
