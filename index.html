               This page is intended to provide a record of the work
               that I am doing to repair and restore my Jeep CJ2A.
               I purchased the jeep on November 14, 2016 for $2700. The
               vital stats are:

               <p>

               This is a 1947 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_CJ#CJ-2A">Willy's Jeep CJ2A</a>
               that was converted to 12V before I bought it.  There are a few "repairs" that are not original
               but most of this Jeep is original equipment for the CJ2A.  The frame and sheet metal were in
               great shape, there are a few holes in a few of the side panels but it has remarkably little rust.

<h2>Willy's Jeep CJ2A TODO List</h2>
</a>

updated 2016-11-17

<p>

As I dig into the jeep I am making a list of the work that I am going to need to get done,
the goal is to have a safe, reliable, running jeep.  A secondary goal is to restore the
Jeep to something that looks close to the M38, however I am not trying to be strictly
historically accurate.  I really enjoy being able to drive this around our property
so I am keeping fun running as first priority.

<p>

Some of the smaller maintenance tasks:
<dl>
   <dt>Replace battery cables</dt>
   <dd>I am using a pair of vice grips to hold the negative wire to the negative 
       terminal.  I'd like to be able to use those pliers for other things. I expect to spend about $50 on
		 this.</li>
   </dd>
   
   <dt>Add an air filter</dt>
   <dd>The jeep was being run with the carburetor open to the world, I think it
       would be good to put something there to get particles smaller than 2" across
       out of the carb. I expect this to cost about $40 since I will use a
		 simple paper filter (and case) that slips on over the carb.</dd>

	<dt>Shocks</dt>
	<dd>I am almost certain that I need new shock absorbers.  This isn't a top priority since the
		 transmission needs attention before I can do much driving. </dd>

	<dt>D rings</dt>
	<dd>Add D rings to the front bumper and rear hitch assembly for better tie down points when trailering.</dd>

<h3>Transmission Rebuild</h3>

The transmission slips out of second gear and occasionally sticks in third
gear which requires that you remove the shifter cover and use your finger
to put the gears where they belong.  This is not optimal.  I plan on 
rebuilding the transmission myself (what's the worst that can happen?).

<p>

The Novak T-90 rebuild kit is priced at $255 and seems to be highly recommended.
I have read that I should take the transmission apart to get a better idea of
what replacement parts I will need and order them before beginning reassembly.
The seller that I bought the Jeep from included a spare transmission and
transfer case that were both fully disassembled.

<p>

<hr>

<h3>Parking Brake Reassembly</h3>

<p>

THe parking brake was not attached to the transmission when I bought the jeep.  I need to
put it back together because using wheel chocks is hard when you are by yourself trying to
park on an incline.

<hr>

<h3>Body panels</h3>

<p>

Some of the body panels need to be repaired. They are mostly in good shape, but the side
panels have some rot and large holes in a few places.  My current plan is to cut the sections out,
fabricate patches that match the original design and weld them in place.

<hr>

<h3>Steering Box Rebuild</h3>

<p>

The steering has a LOT of play.  It looks like this is between the steering column and the steering box,
I suspect that the steering box will need to be rebuilt.

<hr>

<h3>Tires</h3>

<p>

The tires that were on the jeep when I bought it were badly cracked.  I don't expect them
to last very long, my hope is that I can keep air in them until I get a little more money
in the first quarter.  I am currently planning on putting bias-ply tires on since they are cheaper and
I don't plan on putting this Jeep on the road.  I like the look for the non-directional tread (that
is what I remember being on the Jeeps when I was in the army).  I expect to spend about $800-$900 since
I also need a rim for a spare.

<p>

I am not certain what wheels came on the Jeep - need to figure out what I have to work with.

<hr>

<h3>Spare Tire Mount</h3>

<p>

There is no spare tire mount - not sure what happened to it.  The stock CJ2A had the spare mounted
on the right side rear to provide easier access to the tailgate.  I like this idea and will probably
build the spare tire mount on the right side where it should be.


<hr>

<h3>Rear Seat</h3>

<p>

There is no rear seat, however I really like the idea of adding a seat so that I can take a few
passengers around more comfortably.  Remember that the goal is to be able to scoot around on 
our property and between the houses out in our part of the woods.  We often use a golf cart or
a car, but this would be a nifty alternative if I had a seat there.  The frame is usually about
$250 and that still needs upholstry.  

<hr>

<h3>Dashboard Panel Replacement</h3>

<p>

The dashboard has been cut and drilled in a number of places, I suspect that I will need to replace it.
I might be able to patch it but need to look at it more closely.  It would be nice to get a replacement
shifter diagram plate to mount to the dash.

<hr>

<h3>Fuel Can Holder</h3>

<p>

I'd like to add a mount for a 5 gallon fuel can to the tailgate or to the left side.  Haven't decided
whether I want to impede the use of the tailgate, it really isnt very important given the shallow
depth of the back.  If I decide to put a rear seat in then a functional tailgate is even less important.
